# Running with Docker

## Installation

### Option 1: Using ADSB.IM Image

1.  Download and install the [ADSB.im](https://adsb.im) image on your device
2.  Follow their [how-to guide](https://www.adsb.im/howto) for hardware setup and image loading

3.  Delete the userland-proxy line from docker's daemon.json:

    1. Navigate to the Docker directory and open the `daemon.json` file in a text editor:

    ```shell
    cd /etc/docker
    sudo nano daemon.json
    ```

    3. Locate the line containing `"userland-proxy": false,` and delete it.

    4. Save the changes and exit the editor (in nano, press `CTRL + O`, then `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X`).

4.  Proceed to the [Configuration and Running](#configuration-and-running) section

### Option 2: Manual Setup with ADSB.im and Ubuntu

üìå **Note:** If you already have Git and Docker installed, skip to step 6: [Install ADSB.im](#install-adsbim)

1. Update your system:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

2. Install Docker and docker-compose:

**Note:** Some OS's have "docker-compose-v2" others use "docker-compose-plugin" Use the one which exists for your os - either will install the newer version of docker compose.

```shell
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose docker-compose-v2
```
or
```shell
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose docker-compose-plugin
```

3. To run Docker commands without sudo, add your user to the Docker group:

```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker $USERNAME
```

üìù **Note:** fill in your username like `JOHNDOE`

4. Apply the new group membership:

```shell
newgrp docker
```

5. Install Git

```shell
sudo apt install git
```

6. #### Install ADSB.im:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirkhh/adsb-feeder-image/main/src/tools/app-install.sh | sudo bash
```

## Configuration and Running

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LoganSound/CopterFeeder.git
cd CopterFeeder
```

2. Set up the environment file:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

üìù Fill in the API key and feeder name values provided by the dev team

üìù For the port number, comment out the line which does not apply to your situation by putting a `#` in front of it

üí° **Nano tips:** Save: `Ctrl+O`, `Enter` | Exit: `Ctrl+X`

3. Build and run the Docker container:

```shell
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

üìù **Note:** the -d flag runs the container in the background.

4. (Optional) View logs:

```shell
docker compose logs -f
```

üìù **Note:** `Ctrl-C` escapes you from viewing logs

## Updating CopterFeeder

1. Navigate to the project folder and pull the latest

```shell
cd ./CopterFeeder
git pull
```

2. Build and restart the Docker container:

```shell
docker compose down
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

# Legacy Read Me

## -- BELOW HERE IS NOT UPDATED --

Start by running

```Shell
sudo apt-get update
```

If your system hasn't had its Operating system updated in a while, you may need to run:

```Shell
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

or

```Shell
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

The following is required if you don't have pip3 installed (eg: FR24 feeder images ) - Note that in later OS releases, it is not recommended to use "sudo pip3" to install libraries, rather either using the OS tools like apt to install python-XYZ or using a "venv" is preferred. See: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/ for more detailed information.

```Shell
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

Get the CopterFeeder script using git:

```Shell
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/LoganSound/CopterFeeder.git
```

move into the project folder:

```Shell
cd CopterFeeder/
```

And then (optionally) download the latest helicopter database. This functionality has been included in the main feeder script so is now an optional step.

```Shell
wget "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSEyC5hDeD-ag4hC1Zy9m-GT8kqO4f35Bj9omB0v2LmV1FrH1aHGc-i0fOXoXmZvzGTccW609Yv3iUs/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv" -O "bills_operators.csv"
```

OR (preferred, but still optional) use the incluided "get_bills.py" script to pull the csv file.

```Shell
./get_bills.py
```

Run pip3 to install requirements

```Shell
python3 -m pip3 --user install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy example_env_file to .env ( this should only have to be done for the first install!!!)

```Shell
cp  example_dot_env .env
```

Add your credentials or API-key, and Feeder-ID type to the .env file

```Shell
nano .env
```

Change the permissions on the .env file so that only you read Read/Write the file:

```Shell
chmod go-rwx .env
```

Credentials can also be specified using command line options (see below). Command line options
take precedence over environtment settings. Note that Userid/Password specified on the commandline
will be able to be seen by others using "ps -ef"

Make the main script executable

```Shell
chmod +x feed_copterspotter.py
```

The script needs to be told how to get to the "aircraft.json" on your ADS-B Feeder. It can do this either
by reading local files using the "-r" option or by making a request over the net to small webserver packaged
with the feeder software (dump1090) which is typically lighthttp or similar. Because there are different
directories and urls for this different versions of software, the best way to do this in your setup may
take a bit of trial and error. If you are running the script on the system you use as a ADS-B feeder,
you might want to start with the "-r" option, which will scan several different directories under /run.
If you're on a different machine, you'll want to use the server (-s) and port (-p) options. Note: if you use
the -r option, -s and -p options will be ignored.

The script is intended to be run as a daemon (-d option):

```Shell

./feed_copterspotter.py -d -r

```

Or run on the command line, so that you can watch debugging output (-D option):

```Shell

./feed_copterspotter.py -D -r

```

If you want to run from Crontab, use the -o (one shot) option.

#type:

```Shell
crontab -e
```

And add the following lines (these file paths need to match wherever you installed to, below is example for /home/pi/CopterFeeder):

```Code



Note: Examples below assume the script is installed in "/home/pi/"  - this is not a
requirement and certainly not a recommendation - the script can be installed in a
convenient directory of your choice.

* * * * * python3 /home/pi/CopterFeeder/feed_copterspotter.py -o -r >> copterspotter.log 2>&1
0 0 * * * wget "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSEyC5hDeD-ag4hC1Zy9m-GT8kqO4f35Bj9omB0v2LmV1FrH1aHGc-i0fOXoXmZvzGTccW609Yv3iUs/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv" -O "/home/pi/CopterFeeder/bills_operators.csv"
```

And you're DONE!

You can TEST one iteration by typing:

```Shell

python3 feed_copterspotter.py -o -r



```

When an identifyied helicopter is nearby, in verbose mode (-v switch) or debug mode
(-D switch), the script will output lines something like:

```Code
Helicopter Reported: 1674864903.049228 A139 TRP7 450 600 97.22 38.909385,-76.845398 5107
```

You can optionally log those reports to a file using the -l option, which can be handy if
you're running in daemon mode:

```Code

feed_copterspotter.py -d -l /full/path/to/logfile

```

You can do:

```Code
tail -f /full/path/to/logfile
```

to watch the logging messages in the logfile.

Note: the -D debug mode will be very noisy as it is intended for debugging - you probably want to use -v or -l to just see periodic reports.

If you consistently see "None" or "Null" we may need to tweak your variables

Help is available with the -h or --help option:

```Code
./feed_copterspotter.py --help

usage: feed_copterspotter.py [-h] [-V] [-v] [-D] [-d] [-o] [-l LOG] [-w] [-i INTERVAL] [-s SERVER] [-p PORT]

  -r, --readlocalfiles  Check for aircraft.json files under /run/...
```

## Running as Docker

This script can be (arguably, should be as it simplifies many things) run as a Docker container, using docker-compose or docker compose, depending on which version of docker you have installed. Running CopterFeeder using Docker will simplify setup as a dameon, and will help simplify Python configs, especially under recent OS releases, which push using venv to avoid library conflicts. This is a bit more advanced method - detailing all of the tasks needed for installing and setting up Docker is out of the scope of this readme. There is plenty of documentation available elsewhere, from Docker, from OS maintainers and from other 3rd parties.

Note: If you're using (recommended!) https://adsb.im/home image - docker-ce (community edition) is already installed. It includes the "compoose" command, so you don't need to install anything extra. Just setup ssh or shell access, login, clone the CopterFeeder github repository and skip to the "setup the .env" step below.

If you are not using the adsb.im, to use this script with docker you will first need to install Docker and docker compose on your machine. If you need help for this step, search the web for your version of Linux, etc. It could be as simple as:

```Shell
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
```

There may be other setup steps required - such as adding yourself to the docker group to give yourself priveledges to run docker without needed root access. Again, out of scope for this readme.md file. Depending on which version of docker you have installed, it may already include "compose" -- as such, you may not need to install docker-compose. If this is the case, just use "docker compose" instead of "docker-compose"

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/LoganSound/CopterFeeder.git
cd CopterFeeder
```

Next - setup the .env file as outlined above, using the credentials you've been provided for copter-spotter.

Run docker-compose to build the container:

```Shell
docker compose build
```

And then run the container:

```Shell
docker compose up -d
```

If you'd like to see debug and loogging use:

```Shell
docker compose logs -f
```

If you're curious about what Docker is doing, see the Dockerfile and the docker-compose.yml file.
